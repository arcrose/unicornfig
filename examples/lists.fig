; Fig supports lists, which can contain any types of values, and they need
; not all be the same within a single list.

(print (list 1 3.14 "hi" (list true 0)) ; Prints [1 3.14 hi [true 0]]

; You can get the first element of a list with the first function.

(print (first (list 1 2 3))) ; Prints 1

; you can get the tail of a list (everything but the first element) with tail.

(print (tail (list 1 2 3))) ; Prints [2 3]

; You can also append items to the end of a list with append.
; This function requires the first argument be a list, and one or more
; arguments to append can follow.

(print (append (list 1 2) 3 4 5)) ; Prints [1 2 3 4 5]

; You cannot use the length function to find out how many elements are in a list,
; however the size function exists for this purpose.

(print (size (list 1 2 3))) ; Prints 3
