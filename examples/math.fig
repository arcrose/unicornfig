; The four basic arithmetic operations are supported, along with modulo.
; Note that each of these functions accept two or more arguments, so
; (+ 1 2 3 4) is the same as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 and so on for the other functions.

(print (+ 1 1 2))  ; Prints 4
(print (- 3 3 1))  ; Prints -1 
(print (* 2 11))   ; Prints 22
(print (/ 110 10)) ; Prints 11
(print (% 3 2))    ; Prints 1

; The following comparison functions are also available.
; Negation is demonstrated in examples/bools.fig.

(print (> 1 2))    ; Prints false
(print (<= 2 2))   ; Prints true
(print (>= 103 4)) ; Prints true
(print (< 10 11))  ; Prints true

; There is also a convenient function for testing if a number is 0.
; The value of pi is also stored in a globally-available variable.

(print (zero? (- pi pi))) ; Prints true
