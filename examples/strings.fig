; Strings can be contained between "double quotes" or 'single quotes'.
; Also, one type of string can contain the other.
; So "Hi 'Bob'!" and 'Hey, "Alice"!' are both valid strings.

; You can concatenate (add) strings together with concat.
; the function accepts any number of string arguments.

(print (concat "Hello," " " "world!")) ; Prints "Hello, world!" without quotes.

; You can also take a substring of a string from a start and end index using substr.
; Note that the start index is inclusive and the end index is not inclusive.

(print (substr "Hello world" 1 5)) ; Prints "ello" without quotes.
(print (substr "Hi!" 0 3))         ; Prints "Hi!" without quotes.

; The length function calculates the length of a string.

(print (length "test")) ; Prints 4

; The index function gets the index at which a substring can be found in
; another string starting from the left. It outputs -1 if the substring isn't found.

(print (index "Hey there!" "the")) ; Prints 4

; You can easily convert strings to all uppercase or all lowercase with
; the upcase and downcase functions.

(print (upcase "Hello world")) ; Prints "HELLO WORLD" without quotes.
(print (downcase "WOW!"))      ; Prints "wow!" without quotes.

; You can also split a string using the split function.
; Doing so gives you a list of strings.

(print (split "hello world" " ")) ; Prints [hello world]

; A single character at a particular index can be retrieved using the at function.

(print (at "hello" 4)) ; Prints "o" without quotes
