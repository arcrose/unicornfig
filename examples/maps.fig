; Maps or mappings are the equivalent of dictionaries (dict) in Python
; or objects in Javascript. They map strings to any value, including
; lists or other maps.

;; Prints map[hello:2 world:3.14 !:[1 2 3 4]]
(print (mapping 
    "hello" 2
    "world" 3.14
    "!" (list 1 2 3 4)))

; You can also associate new key-value pairs together much like appending
; items to a list. The first argument to assoc must be a map, and then
; an even number of arguments can be supplied in the form key1 value1 key2 value2.

;; Prints map[a:1 b:2 c:3.14 d:Hey!]
(print (assoc (mapping "a" 1) "b" 2 "c" 3.14 "d" "Hey!"))

; You can extract the value contained in a map associated with a key using get.

(print (get (mapping "a" 1 "b" 0) "a")) ; Prints 1

; To get a list of the keys in a map as a list of strings, use the keys function.

(print (keys (mapping "a" 1 "b" 2 "c" 4))) ; Prints [a b c]
